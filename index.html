                    <p> I am 21 years young and currently studying my third year in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. From an early age I was extremely fascinated by computers, technology and software.  My father introduced me to man-machine interface software at his workplace and that's what first sparked my interest. Ever since, I knew my true calling. <br /> <br /> 

                    As I continue to develop my theoretical background, Computer Science has become a natural progression. As of now: C, C++, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, Scheme are all weapons in my arsenal for building algorithms. Whether I am working on school assignments, or side-projects; I love getting my hands dirty and making things work, especially when it involves exploring new challenges. 
                    My knowledge of data structures, algorithms, object-oriented software design, and logical computation has given me the tools to succeed. 
                    </br> <br/> All in all, my family values, cultural background and passion, makes me humble, reliable, and trustworthy.</p>

                                Participated at AI for social good, a hackathon organized by TD Bank in Montreal, where I met a lawyer and a seasoned Java developer. The lawyer had the idea of building an application that would make it easier for lawyers to perform comparative analysis when observing court cases. The idea was to lessen the time, cost, and work lawyers have to do to find legal precedent. <br><br>
                                
                                We first designed a plan of attack. <br>
                                1.	Lawyer will explain the challenge he is facing and the problem he wants to solve.<br>
                                2.	The java developer will scrape court cases from a public webpage. <br>
                                3.	I will ramp-up on Doc2Vec and build the back-end for the project.<br>
                                4.	Java developer will give me the scraped court cases in txt format. <br>
                                5.	I will train a model on the court cases using the doc2vec algorithm. <br>
                                6.	I will set up a flask application to use the model and load up a webpage. <br>
                                7.	The java developer and I will build a webpage where the model is used. <br> <br>
                                
                                Unfortunately, we faced many challenges when scraping the court cases. Many of the websites had cookies or JavaScript that was blocking us. Luckily, we found an Australian ______ that we were able to successfully scrape to show our proof of concept. <br>
                                <br> 
                                The end result, is the LawyerUp application.

                                We wanted to build something that gives you feedback when you're playing the violin. Most of the time, beginners don't have an ear for correctness in terms of the music, so feedback is very important early on to becoming a good musician. <br>
                                
                                <h3> What it does </h3> 
                                Our app is on the Android platform, which uses the microphone to listen to the music being played. Our backend API parses .mid files that you can build with MuseScore, and our app will compare the song being played to the sheet music that was parsed. The phone app will then give you feedback in sequence whether the notes are correct and then give you a percentage summary on how you did. <br>
                                
                                <h3> How We built it </h3>
                                We used most of the app using a baseline for reading sound input and then incorporating logic for the analysis of the microphone and calculating feedback. The parsed song itself is put onto a stack of notes, and then each note is popped off the stack when it has a successful read. We used Heroku to host our Node.js API which parses the song's sheet music, and then used Android's functionality to read in the microphone input and generate feedback. <br> 
                                
                                <h3> Challenges We ran into </h3>
                                Since our application involves dealing with reading frequencies in real time. There were many instances where external sounds had an impact on our readings. Additionally, since our program is analyzing real-time music while performing a comparative analysis to frequencies of the same song played perfectly, there were many instances where frequencies were misinterpreted by our engine. We were able to handle this by creating a stack-popping algorithm with a button to indicate when the song has finished playing. This was a simple, but optimal solution to our problem. <br> 
                                
                                Another issue that we faced was having to ramp up on Android development. Luckily, one of our group members (Simran) had prior experience with android and was able to provide support to our other members. <br>
                                
                                <h3> Accomplishments that we're proud of </h3>
                                We are proud of the fact that our application works. We all ended up learning something new; android development, deploying an API with Heroku, managing a project among four people, working with sound and microphone input. We believe that building this application was extremely challenging, especially under a time constraint and the mathematics behind manipulating and reading sound input; however, our strong teamwork helped us persevere through this difficult task, and make it become something functional. <br>
                                
                                <h3> What We learned </h3>
                                We learned android mobile development and interesting ways to apply OOP to an android application. We also learned the importance of strong planning. We also learned that working with sound input is very complex because the input comes in as waves and there's a lot of variability in the input due to the microphone on the machine. <br>
                                
                                <h3> What's next for SoundMatch </h3>
                                SoundMatch is an application that we would love to make IOS compatible. As well, there are a few tweaks we would like to perform on our application to increase accuracy and performance. There's also room for machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis of one's music performance, and how to make the app so it's resilient to other sound waves interfering with the music being played; this would be cool to incorporate in the future. <br>

                                While working at CAE, I was asked to ramp up on C#. I spent many hours learning about the language, but I figured that the best way to learn was by building a project. I was impressed by Windows Forms and how easy it was to build an app. I decided that I wanted to build a calculator, but with my own algorithms for each mathematical operation. I focused on efficiency and design when building this project.<br><br> 
                                
                                After the calculator was finished, I wanted to incorporate data analysis in some way. I was living with an individual at the time who was in charge of Canadian stocks of a large lens manufacturing company. After spending hours discussing stocks and the stock market, I decided to add a graph showcasing real-time stock data onto my calculator UI. <br><br>

                                While studying CS246 at the University of Waterloo; we were asked to build a console-based video game for our final project in C++. I partnered up with a friend to build the famous game ChamberCrawler3000 or CC3K. The development of the game involved a large focus on software engineering design principles and diagrams reflecting OOP. The game has four levels of heuristic AI, custom board setup and generation, and score keeping.

                            <p class = "secondpara">Growing up I played competitive hockey for my local hockey association. The countless hours spent at the rink has allowed me to not only build friendships, but also a strong competitive attitude. I am extremely grateful, and so I needed to find a way to give back to my local organization. In the past, a parent would always keep track of the stats of a certain game on a piece of paper, and then transfer the data onto an online database. This task allowed for many errors to occur, whether a game stat was recorded incorrectly or while transferring the data from paper to computer there were mistakes. I wanted to facilitate the experience by building an application that would get rid of the paper completely. <br/> <br/>

                            So, I built a Hockey Database in C++,  to store stats for a full hockey team. Stats can be added for the whole team or each individual player. All stats are customizable throughout the execution of the program. The database uses file reading and writing to store and retrieve team stats. At first the application was fully console based; however, after I introduced the idea to my local hockey team, a GUI was built using Qt Creator. The program has been used in 2016 by the Orleans Blues Hockey Association. </p>

                                <b> Inspiration: </b><br/>
                                After creating a handful of 2D games, I decided to challenge myself to build a 3D game from scratch. I wanted to have full control of my game; hence, I designed the map, physics, character models, animations, AI logic, and networking from scratch. I tried to stay away from using Unity prefabs/packages since I wanted full control of my game. <br/> 
                                I was quickly able to learn that the math was much more complex. Rendering, physics, and collisions involved an extra dimension now. I enjoyed applying the linear algebra knowledge I obtained while taking course at University to my game.  <br/>
                                I was also quickly able to learn the importance of optimization. While making 2D games, I was able to program without taking into considering the performance of my game (in most cases). In 3D, however, without considering optimizing methods, performance can be greatly impacted. Since, my game is networked, this could cause even more problems. <br/><br/>
                                <b>Without AI bots:</b><br/>
                                My first implementation of IslandConquor didn’t have AI bots. It was simply a multiplayer game where one player would be the host, and the rest of the players would simply be clients. When a player joins the game session, an reference to the player with a unique id is stored in a dictionary that contains all players currently in the game. Then a function is run on the server which then calls functions on all clients currently in the game to display the new player. Shooting, damage, and movement is communicated from the server to all clients in a similar fashion. <br/><br/>
                                <b>With AI bots:</b><br/>
                                Upon completing the multiplayer version of the game, I wanted to see if I would be able to build bots that would be able interact, attack, and move freely around the map. I was curious to see if I could instantiate, and communicate movements, damage, and respawning the same way I did with real-players. I started by defining a radius around each AI bot, so that if a player enters that space they will be attacked. In terms of movement, I generated three random numbers, one number that defines how long the bot will move, and another number that defines how long the bot will move. In addition, I made the bots responsive to being attacked, so when a player decides to attack a bot, they will respond by attacking the player. Finally, I made sure that all these factors were well synced over the network so that each player playing the game sees the same bots and is experiencing the same game. <br/><br/>
                                All in all, this was an excellent opportunity to explore 3-dimensional game development and apricate the math, planning, and design involved. <br/><br/>

                                <b> Inspiration: </b> <br/>
                                I wanted to build an application that provides feedback to users player various instruments. The application can be used by individuals with varying levels of skill; however, the main purpose is to help beginners that don’t have an ear for correctness in terms of the music, so feedback is very important early on to become a good musician. Additionally, this application will help individuals who may not have the funds to pay for a music instructor. <br/> 

                                The first implementation of this app was done at Hack the North, a Waterloo-based hackathons; where I, collaborated with three students to build a prototype of Music Instructor. The prototype lacked UI design, and the algorithm that evaluates players was very week. The algorithm used a stack, which would mean that when a user is playing a song, if they were to miss a note, our app would constantly be listening for that note until that note is popped off the stack. <br/>

                                I have decided to update the algorithm, as well as design a friendly UI to make the experience more accurate and better overall. <br/><br/>

                                <b> What it does: </b> <br/>
                                The app is currently on the Android platform; however, I do which to deploy it on IOS as well. Music Instructor uses the microphone to listen to music being played. I built a backend API, hosted as a Heroku app, that parses .midi files, and feeds a collection of notes to the app, and the app uses these notes to compare to a user playing a song in real-time. To ensure accuracy, I feed the BPM time associated with the song from the API to the app. Using this value during each iterations the app waits the amount of time expected for the beat to happen (while factoring in time that is wasted when the loop iterates). If the note is not played during that time frame, the app will move and an try to match another note. The reason I wait the whole time frame, is because when a user plays a note it is possible that play a multitude of notes before hitting the note that they wish to play. When a user plays a note poorly, the app records this in a collection, and at the end provides a score, as well, as a summary stating each note that the player has missed, and where in the song that note is. <br/><br/>

                                After discussing about the ophthalmic industry with a director at a lens manufacturing company, I was inspired to work on this project. There has been a recent rise in consumers purchasing glasses from online retailers. Therefore,I was told that there is demand for effective web applications that facilitate user experience when buying glasses. The director wondered if there could be a way for customers to try on different frames online before visiting stores to purchase them. This could attract more customers and lower time spent servicing these customers at various store locations. Hence, I decided to use an open cv library in python to build an application that will detect eyes and ears to enable individuals to try on different frames before vising stores. The application is still a WIP and so far I have completed the eye detection using opencv and a TensorFace shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat model.

                            Built a chrome extension that allows users to set notifications and reminders. The application will alert the users once a certain amount of time expires. <br/><br/> Built this project to explore the various components of chrome extensions such correctly setting up the manifest file, designing the popup, and the logic communicating background processes with UI elements of the extension.

                                The idea of a program being able to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicetely programmed, is something that I find truly fascinating. <br/> <br/>
                                I have built two projects, LawyerUp and MyChauffeur, that train models but leverage external modules and algorithms. I wanted to understand more about these algorithms and so I decided to follow machine learning tutorials and online lectures on YouTube. <br/><br/>
                                So far I have built a support vector machine algorithm, a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm, a linear regression algorithm, and a KMeans algorithm. I had a great time building these algorithms because I was able to familiarize myself with popular python modules like scikit-learn, pandas, mathplotlib, scipy, sklearn, and numpy. <br/><br/>
                                I plan to continue learning and I hope that I can soon build a neural network completely from scratch.

                                WLP4 is a small language that is similar to C++ but not quite as complicated. <br/><br/>
                                Build a WLP4 compiler from scratch as a project for my Foundations of Sequential Programs course. <br/><br/>

                                Steps I took in building it: <br/>
                                <small>* Built a scanner that reads in a WLP4 program and breaks it into Tokens. </small> <br>
                                <small>* The scanner is built by following the Simplified Maximal Munch algorithm and a DFA. </small> <br/>
                                <small> * Built a SLR(1) parser from a Context Free Grammar. This step checks for syntactic errors. <br/> </small>
                                <small> * Perform type-checking among other things to ensure that the program is semantically valid. <br/> </small>
                                <small> * Generate MIPS assembly code. <br/> </small> 
                                <small> * Optimize MIPS code by implementing register allocation. </small><br/> <br/>
